parallelism
==========

The `Parallelism` library empowers developers with precise control over parallel and concurrent task execution through its core functions: `scheduled_task` and `task_scheduler`.
The `scheduled_task` function allows users to define, prioritize, and manage individual tasks, seamlessly harnessing the benefits of parallelism and concurrency.
On the other hand, the `task_scheduler` function offers a high-level approach to orchestrating multiple tasks, efficiently distributing them across processes and threads while optimizing resource utilization.
With these functions, the `Parallelism` library simplifies the creation of efficient and responsive Python applications, facilitating both parallel and concurrent execution paradigms.
